# Enhancement-of-Ideal-Rankine-Cycle-for-Power-Plants
## Overview 
This project focuses on enhancing the performance of power plants by modifying the ideal Rankine cycle. The primary objective is to surpass the current thermal efficiency of 41% and achieve steam quality above 85%, while adhering to specific constraints: boiler pressure fixed at 15 MPa, condenser pressure at 10 kPa, and turbine temperature below 500Â°C.
## Key Features
* Modified the Rankine cycle with advanced techniques such as reheating and feedwater heating to improve efficiency and steam quality.
* Utilized Cantera and MATLAB for detailed analysis, achieving a thermal efficiency of 47.45% and a steam quality of 90.42%.
* Varying Boiler and Condenser Pressures: Conducted sensitivity analysis by adjusting boiler pressure (12 MPa to 15 MPa) and condenser pressure (5 kPa to 10 kPa), and visualized the impact on efficiency and net work output using MATLAB plots.
* The project successfully met and exceeded the performance targets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed modifications and optimizing the Rankine cycle for improved power plant efficiency.
